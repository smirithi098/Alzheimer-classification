# Alzheimer classification

In this project, I have analysed a comprehensive dataset containing few of the many characteristics associated with Alzheimer's. The primary objective was to identify the relationship between these characteristics and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's as "Demented" or "Non-Demented" and classify individuals into these two classes/clusters.

The tasks involved in the project:
1. **Preliminary Data Analysis** which included descriptive and statistical analysis to understand the data.
2. **Data Pre-Processing** to handle missing values, standardize numeric values and format variable types.
3. **Clustering** to form and visualize the diagnosis of individuals based on the characteristics as "Demented"/"Non-Demented".
4. **Feature Selection** to identify the most significant characteristics out of the list that helps in classifying the patients and lastly
5. **Classification** to categorize the individuals into two groups of diagnosis.

Overall, this study contributes to better understand Alzheimer's disease and it's potential characteristics.

# Analysis

The dataset contains 10 columns with one being the diagnosis (*Group*) and rest are the corresponding factors influencing the diagnosis to name a few, *Gender*, *Socioeconomic status (SES)*, *Estimated total intracranial volume(eTIV)*, *Clinical dementia rating (CDR)* etc for about 350 individuals.

# Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- Fuzzy k-means clustering
- Feature Selection using **Variable Importance**
- Logistic Regression
- Model Comparison Using **ANOVA**

# Results

A comprehensive analysis of the data was performed to investigate the relationship between various characteristics contributing to Alzheimer's disease and the diagnosis. The implementation of preliminary descriptive and statistical analysis, clustering and classification modelling provided a integrated approach is recognizing the patterns in the factors and identifying the significant factors associated with Alzheimer's diagnosis.
